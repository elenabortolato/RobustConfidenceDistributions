# RobustConfidenceDistributions
code associated to the paper "On approximate robust confidence distributions" (Bortolato and  Ventura 2023)

### Folder "simulation study section 5"
- RDS files containing the resilts of the simulation study
- results_ks_w.R: R code for producing tables 7 8 of the paper using RDS files in the folder
- simulations_ks_w.R: R code for running the simulation study


### Folder "simulation study section 4"
- R code for reproducing the results in each scenario (cont_40, cont_80, nocont_40, nocont_80)
 nocont: non contaminated scenario, cont: contaminated, 40 and 80 for the total sample size
- RData files containing the results of each simulation study
### Tutorial based on the a real data example in section 4.2
